  "A Cozy Bar to Call Home in Ridgewood, Queens"

  On a block of brick rowhouses, the bar has the appeal of a tavern in a sleepy village. Inside, it evokes a Midwestern family’s lake house with a fake fireplace, wide-plank wood floors, brick walls and shelves heaving with books, board games and youth league trophies. -[Read more…](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/fashion/bar-ridgewood-queens.html)

  "GRAND OPENING! Bad Old Days Bar in Ridgewood!"

  The Bad Old Days bar is finally open in Ridgewood! Yay!! It opened last Saturday to a ton of locals. The owners Rina and Sonja were bartenders for over a decade around the area including Queens Tavern on Fresh Pond Road. Opening a bar has been a longtime goal for both of them. Rina is from upstate New York and Sonja is from the Mid-West.

  This place is definitely fun, cozy, and deserves to be in this neighborhood. I hope you will welcome them here as much as I did. Their hard work has definitely paid off. -[Read more…](https://www.ridgewoodsocial.com/2015/11/30/grand-opening-the-bad-old-days-bar-in-ridgewood/)

  "Cozy Up at The Bad Old Days in Ridgewood"

  It couldn’t have been a more perfect night for stopping into The Bad Old Days, or maybe there’s no better bar for a rainy night. Either way, immediately after walking into this brand new bar in Ridgewood I felt like I was in some kind of geothermal beer womb. Warmth radiates up from the wooden floorboards and out of the living room lamps, and half-curtains hug the tall windows, shielding boozers from the depressing weather outside. If you need a new winter bar, here’s a stellar contender. -[Read more…](http://bedfordandbowery.com/2015/12/cozy-up-at-the-bad-old-days-in-ridgewood/)

  "Do you hate your roommates? Welcome to The Bad Old Days, Ridgewood’s new living room"

  From the outside, the quaint little corner of Cypress Avenue and Woodbine Street looks quiet and private; white curtains shield glass windows and big double doors hold the chatter of the bar quietly inside. Once you find your way in, however, it’s a different story: you’re greeted with rows of books, shelves of knickknacks, cozy couches, a faux fireplace and a friendly crew of regulars. Welcome to your new living room. -[Read more…](https://qns.com/story/2016/06/17/do-you-hate-your-roommates-welcome-to-the-bad-old-days-ridgewoods-new-living-room/)
